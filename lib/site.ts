/* ============================================================
   SITE CONTENT — everything about Aditi rather than about a
   project: the intro, the stats, the timeline, the skills.

   This module is client-safe on purpose. The case studies live in
   lib/data.ts, which is marked server-only, because a client component
   imports its whole module into the browser bundle and some case-study
   content is under NDA. Anything a "use client" component needs belongs
   here; anything that quotes a case study does not.
